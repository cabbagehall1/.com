                  <p class="style7">There has been a major increase in interest 
                    for produce direct from the Farm. The consumer and the farmer 
                    need to have a more direct relationship, As  
                    supermarkets are well placed and they are better able to service 
                    a large amount of the population, this is good and necessary. we hope to offer a personal door step service
                    and with fuel costs its not always convenient to pop back 
                    to the super market if some thing is forgotten. with no minimum 
                    order policy we can drop off any forgotten items with you 
                    milk deliveries.</p>
                  <p class="style7"> We believe that a reduction in food miles 
                    makes a lot of sense and to make local farmers more accessible 
                    to the local population, we aim to do this in a small way. 
                  </p>
<p class="style7"><br />
                    And the Internet is a good way of achieving this so - Good 
                    food for a Good Price. </p>
